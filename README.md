# Challenge02Portfolio
## Description

This is a project where I created the basis of a web porfolio using the recent information we went over concerning CSS, media queries, and flexbox. This code features semantic HTML terms, the CSS is meant to be easy to modify and organized so that you know what and where you are changing. This website will also change layouts at 992px and 768px for readability and to make sure that all the content is visible. This site is meant to be a launchpad/shell demonstrating what the portfolio would look like, adaptability and organization are major tenets therein.

## Usage

The navigation links located in the navigation bar on the left will take you to the appropriate sections of the website. The images of projects will not bring you anywhere, they are linked to null as placeholders for future projects. Be sure to resize the website to see how it collapses for smaller width screens. If viewing the code there are comments detailing a few different thoughts and ideas while writing the code. There is a link to the website in the about section of the repository, here is a a screenshot of the website: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123116188/217740712-cb4b6814-c41d-44a5-9672-82778f03685b.png)
